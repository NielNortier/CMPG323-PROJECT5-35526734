In this Project I have used various visualization Techniques to Report the data obtained by the API and website.
I created a live connection to the hosted sharepoint excel file provided in this course. This was a bit of a tricky one as I was unsure that I created the coorrect connection.

There are 3 Pages available . 'High-leve Metrics', 'Device Monitoring' and 'Device registration' Both containing their own unique data visualization.

'High-Level Metrics'

This page is used to visualy represent High-level metrics that may contain improtant data to the company. I Included what I thought would be important to the company.

With Device monitoring the user is able to see varouis insightful information regarding to the devices. Like what is acvtive and what zones and catagories are popular.

With device registration, a more time focused apprach was taken. Users are able to see visualizations in treads to get a better insight of when devices are registered.

With regards to reporting and filtering. There are page specefic filters and then filters that are applicable over all pages. I also included a filter to constantly see what devices are active or inactive
